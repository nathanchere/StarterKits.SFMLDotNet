StarterKits.SFMLDotNet
======================

The purpose of the starter kits is to provide a package which compiles out-of-the-box with no stuffing around.

This one focuses on SFML.Net - the official .Net bindings for SFML (Simple Fast Multimedia Library) by [Laurent Gomila](mailto:laurent@sfml-dev.org).


The demo doesn't do anything other than get a bare basic SFML window up and running, however the demo project includes (hopefully) all the relevant dependencies required to allow you to work through the SFML and SFML.Net tutorials without worrying about why it won't build.
